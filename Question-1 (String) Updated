Question-1 (String) Updated

Coding Question 1: Based on String
Write a program to print the following output: 

Input: a1b2c3
Output: abbccc
Caution: Don't use inbuilt functions
Explanation:

After we have the number 1 so a repeats one time = a
After b we have the number 2 so it repeats two times = bb
After c we have the number 3 so it repeats three times = ccc
Final Output: abbccc
Algorithm:

Start the Program
Get the input as a single string
Loop through the entire string to find the numbers
After finding the number, Repeat the previous character the same number of times
For example a4 ( So you find the number 4 and print a 4 times)
Follow step 3,4 for the entire string
End the Program
