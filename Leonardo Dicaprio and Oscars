Leonardo Dicaprio and Oscars

You have to write a function that describe Leo:

if oscar was (integer) 88, you have to return "Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy".
if oscar was 86, you have to return "Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!"
if it was not 88 or 86 (and below 88) you should return "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"
if it was over 88 you should return "Leo got one already!"

INPUT 1:

85

OUTPUT 1:

When will you give Leo an Oscar?

Code :

import java.util.*;
class Leo
{
    public void me1()
    {
        System.out.println("Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy");
    }
    public void me2()
    {
        System.out.println("Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!");
    }
    public void me3()
    {
        System.out.println("When will you give Leo an Oscar?");
    }
}
public class Oscar
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        Leo as=new Leo();
        if(a==88)
        {
            as.me1();
        }
        else if(a==86)
        {
            as.me2();
        }
        else if(a!=88 && a!=86 && a<88)
        {
            as.me3();
        }
        else
        {
           System.out.println("Leo got one already!");
        }
        
    }
}
